## Description

This is a python based automation script which completely automates all of the fundamental features of XFLR5 software by coding a pre-defined route for mouse and keyboard functions using the pyautogui package available in python.

## Progress

(1) All the fundamental features have been automated.

(2) Need to test the code for any potential bugs before moving on to the next process.

(3) Need to code the process to facilitate multiple automated iterations.

## Current features

(1) Import foils from Users PC to XFLR5

(2) Create multiple Air foils

(3) Analyze Specific or All foils depending on users choice

(4) Create Plane Designs

(5) Setup and Run Flight analysis

(6) Setup and Run Stability analysis

## Requirements

(1) XFLR5: [DOWNLOAD](http://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm)

(2) pyautogui package: [DOWNLOAD](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)

(3) Any IDE(recommended): For ease of running the code 

## Instructions

  ### 1. Download:
  * It is recommended that all the script related files be saved on deskstop for reliable loading of foils from the PC.

  ### 2. Input:
  * Users have to input all the parameters in the text file attached and make sure to save the changes before running the script. 
  
  * Do not change the orientation of the file by adding or deleting lines between any input (Working to improve this issue).
  
  ### 3. Fail Safe:
  * If the code does not run as expected or you wish to terminate it for any particular reason, just move the cursor to any of the 4 corners of the screen.
  
  ### 4. Running the script:
  * The code has been divided into 5 individual modules. Run modules one-by-one depending on the task you wish to perform.
